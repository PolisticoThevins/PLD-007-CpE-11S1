HARDWARE DEVELOPERS
  a. Charles Babbage(December 26, 1791). An English polymath, is often thought of as "the man who invented computers.” From 1822 until his death in 1871, 
    he designed three computers, but never actually constructed any of them due to lack of funding (Barfield, 2020). 
  b. Ivan E. Sutherland(May 16, 1938). For more than 2 decades ago, he was known as the inventor and developer of the interactive computer graphics.
    Sutherland was the Fletcher Jones Professor and chair of computer science at CalTech. Prior to joining the CalTech faculty, Sutherland and David C. Evans 
    founded Evans and Sutherland Computer Corporation, where Sutherland served as vice president and chief scientist ("Ivan Edward Sutherland", n.d.).
  c. Seymour Cray(September 28, 1925). Cray, considered the “father of supercomputing,” had left his post at business computing giant Sperry-Rand to join the 
    newly formed Control Data Corporation so that he can focus on developing scientific computers. The title of world’s fastest computer was held at the time 
    by the IBM 7030 “Stretch,” one of the first to use transistors instead of vacuum tubes (Nguyen, 2019).
